# Advent Of Code
These are (some of) my solutions for [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com). I like to use these as a way to challenge myself and broaden my skill set and just have some fun!

Each year I try to challenge myself in a way that is meaningful to me! Like trying out a new language, or limiting what technologies I can use.

You can find more details of the challenges I set myself in the README files for each year (or specific day if I decide to do something extra).

I do this only for the fun of it so these rules are not absolute, if I feel like breaking them for a specific challenge I will!
