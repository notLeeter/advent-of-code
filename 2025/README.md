I've held off on using AI for a long time, but as time goes on I notice that I'm using it more and more even if it's a small problem that I now have had to debug for longer due to AI then if I wrote it myself in the first place.

Therefor this year my primary challenge is to **not** use AI for any of my solutions (what would even be the point in doing these challenges then).

I'm also starting this in Rust as I've wanted to try it for a while now but never really had the time to properly learn it.
I will only be doing this as long as I'm having fun, if I feel like it's becoming a chore I will use another language I'm more familiar with.
